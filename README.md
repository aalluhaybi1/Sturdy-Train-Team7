# Product Overview

- The Rental & Services Management System project, driven by the founder's experiences, aims to make the moving-in process easier for local and international students.
- It addresses gaps in the rental platform market, focusing on apartment rentals and related services tailored for students at UNA

We're going to build an API for an apartment management company. Create the
following database structure. You will have three models (and their
corresponding tables), `Apartment`, `Tenant` and `Lease`, with the following
relationships:

- A tenant has many apartments and has many leases
- An apartment has many tenants and has many leases
- A lease belongs to an apartment and belongs to a tenant

The models should have the following attributes (along with any attributes
needed to create the relationships defined above):

-  Apartment
 -  number
- Tenant
  - name (must be present)
  - age 
- Lease
  - rent (1 - 6 - 12)
## Deliverables

As a user, I can:

- [ ] Create, read, update and delete **Apartments**
- [ ] Create, read, update and delete **Tenants**
- [ ] Create and delete **Lease**
